# The "value" = the average market value of item you are sellin (I.E. the trader sale price) 
# The "Price" = the amount you are listing the item for on the market
# The "Amount"= the number of items you are selling (If greater than 1 item the tax/item increases) 
# Equation is based off of the data posted on the game's wiki here: https://escapefromtarkov.gamepedia.com/Trading
